# Java Masterclass - HelloWorld Exercises

This repository contains introductory Java code examples created as part of a Java programming course. The focus is on understanding fundamental concepts and syntax.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several simple Java classes, each demonstrating specific basic programming principles. These examples serve as foundational exercises for learning Java.

## Concepts Covered

*   Basic Java class structure and the `main` method.
*   Printing output to the console using `System.out.println()`.
*   Declaring and initializing variables (e.g., `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `String`).
*   Using arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, `%`).
*   Implementing conditional logic using `if-else` statements.
*   Using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`).
*   Using the ternary operator (`? :`).

## Files

*   `src/FirstClass.java`: A basic "Hello World" style program printing a personalized greeting.
*   `src/SecondClass.java`: Another simple program printing a greeting.
*   `src/Conditionals.java`: Demonstrates the use of `if-else` statements and the ternary operator for conditional execution.
*   `src/Challenge.java`: A small challenge involving arithmetic operations, the modulo operator (`%`), and boolean logic to check for remainders.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `src` directory (`/Users/mdabuzafar/Documents/learn/java/java-masterclass/HelloWorld/src/`), and compile a specific Java file using the Java compiler (`javac`):
    ```bash
    javac <FileName>.java
    ```
    For example: `javac FirstClass.java`
3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled bytecode using the Java Virtual Machine (`java`):
    ```bash
    java <ClassName>
    ```
    For example: `java FirstClass`

    *(Note: When running, do not include the `.class` extension.)*
